# Sketch Nr. 2: "Pong"
 We tried to recreate the game PONG.
 What is PONG? - There are two player. Spieler1 controles his/her rectangle with UP/LOW. 
 Spieler2 controles his/her rectangle with LEFT/RIGHT
 The ball should colied against the rectangles. If not it dissaperes and comes back 
 so that the game can go on.
